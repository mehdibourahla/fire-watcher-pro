# ITA Facebook source: Apify bridge now, Meta PPCA later

Collect every post of Info Trafic Algérie's Facebook page, not only the subset its website feed
republishes. The target is Meta's Page Public Content Access (PPCA); an Apify collector carries
the posts until PPCA is approved. Measurements of 2026-09-28 decided the design.

## What the measurements showed

- `ita_website` (`infotraficalgerie.com/api/facebook/`) is ITA's curated traffic feed, not a
  mirror: accidents and congestion from three pages (`808412572528916` main, `100263326209599`,
  `101990129373936`), each tagged `region` and `type`.
- Apify task `nadhir-ita-traficalg` (`apify/facebook-posts-scraper`, every 5 min since
  2026-09-23) saw 72 main-page posts from 2026-09-24 15:51 to 2026-09-28 15:25; the website feed
  had 32 of them. Of the 40 it lacked, about 15 were actionable hazards: two fires (`#حريق`), oil
  on motorways, a broken-down vehicle in a live lane, wrong-way drivers, stones thrown from a
  bridge, billboards about to fall. The rest were reader messages, behaviour posts and advice.
- Both sources see a post a median 2 min after publication.
- Nothing ever read the Apify datasets: no webhook, no code on any branch, no prod table.
- Pricing is per event. An empty window still writes a `no_items` record, billed as a post:
  $0.005 post + $0.002 date filter + $0.001 start = $0.008 a run. 910 of the last 1000 runs were
  empty. The account hit its $10 cap on 2026-09-28 at 15:25 UTC; the cycle resets 2026-10-07.

Cost by cadence, simulated on the real post times (19 posts/day):

| Cadence | Per month | Worst delay |
|---|---|---|
| 5 min | $70 | 5 min |
| 15 min | $24 | 15 min |
| 30 min | $13 | 30 min |
| 60 min | $8 | 60 min |

## Decisions

- Target: Meta PPCA (Graph API `/{page-id}/feed`). It needs business verification and App Review;
  the applicant is an Algerian entity not yet registered, so PPCA is months away.
- Interim: Apify at 15 min, about $24/month, behind a fetcher the Graph API later replaces.
- Rejected: self-scraping through Cloudflare Browser Rendering (Facebook login wall, datacenter
  IP blocking, Meta terms); running without a bridge (the reader alerts and fire posts stay
  invisible until PPCA).

## Collector

- New source contract `ita_facebook`: family `civil_information`, criticality `supporting`,
  cadence 15 min, overlap 5 min, warning 45 min, stale 90 min, execution target `cloudflare`,
  `replay_capability` `none`.
- Our scheduler owns the cadence. The Apify schedule `nadhir-ita-every-5-min` is disabled.
- Each job calls `POST /v2/actor-tasks/{task}/run-sync-get-dataset-items` through `archivedFetch`,
  120 s timeout, token in the worker secret `APIFY_TOKEN`, task id in `APIFY_ITA_TASK_ID`.
- The POST body merges over the task input: `onlyPostsNewerThan` is the minutes since the job's
  `data_from` plus 2, clamped to 20–60, so a retried job still covers its own window;
  `resultsLimit` 20, `maxItems=20` and `maxTotalChargeUsd=0.2` cap what one run can cost.
- A run that returns 20 items (the window may hold more) or whose lookback hit the 60-minute cap
  is `partial` and does not mark its interval covered. The busiest windows seen were 4 posts in
  22 minutes and 7 in 60; a claimed job's `data_from` is at most about 52 minutes old.
- No gap replay: the actor filters only by a lower time bound, so replaying an old window would
  fetch and bill every post since then. A slot lost beyond its retry window stays lost; the
  website feed still carries the curated subset.
- Items are validated with zod and mapped to the existing `ItaFeedPost` shape:
  `id` = `${pageAdLibrary.id}_${postId}`, `uri` = `pageName`, `created_time` = `time`,
  `message` = `text`, `region` = `""`, `type` = `[]`. The identity matches the website feed's
  (`808412572528916_<postId>`, `uri=traficalg`).
- A `no_items` record means an empty window: the run succeeds with zero posts. An item failing
  the schema is rejected and counted, and fails the run like a rejected website post. All 106
  posts seen on 2026-09-28 had text and `pageAdLibrary.id` `808412572528916`.

## Storage and extraction

- New RPC `save_ita_facebook_posts(_job, _attempt, _posts)`: asserts the `ita_facebook` lease,
  inserts into `ita_reports`, touches no ETag state. `save_ita_feed` stays `ita_website`-only.
- Dedup, both RPCs: skip the insert when a row with the same `(source_page, source_post_id)` and
  the same `ita_text_key(body)` exists: the text with emoji, hashtags, whitespace and ASCII
  punctuation removed. The website feed rewrites Facebook's text (it drops hashtags such as
  `#iAccident🚨🚨` into `type`): of the 32 posts both sources saw on 2026-09-28, 1 body was
  identical and all 32 keys were. The first source to see a post wins; a text edit still adds a
  revision; an edit that only changes hashtags or emoji does not. An edit reverted to an earlier
  text is not stored again.
  Behaviour change on `ita_website`: a change of `region` or `type` alone no longer creates a
  revision or a republication. A post Apify saw first keeps no website region/type hint; the
  extractor already treats both as unreliable.
- `ita_facebook` only collects. Extraction stays with the `ita_website` job (`claim_ita_extractions`,
  5 per 5-min run, about 60/hour against roughly 30 new posts/day), so retries, quarantine and
  `prepare_source_recovery` keep one owner.

## Failure and budget

- A capped account answers HTTP 403 `{"error":{"type":"platform-feature-disabled","message":
  "Monthly usage hard limit exceeded"}}` (observed 2026-09-28). The run fails with private
  diagnostic `Apify usage cap reached (HTTP 403)` and public code `upstream_unreachable`: a new
  public code would need strings in four locales for one source. A timeout or 5xx fails the run
  for the next slot. The contract thresholds put a dead collector in `source_watchdog`, and the
  existing operator alert reaches Telegram within the hour.
- `ita_facebook` stays out of the public map's `relevantKeys` banner on purpose: a capped bridge
  must not tell every user the map is limited. `/status` shows its label from the database.
- At most 96 runs/day. The owner sets the Apify account's hard monthly limit to $30.

## PPCA track

1. Register the Algerian entity (company or association).
2. Create a Meta Business account in the exact legal name, with a `@nadhir.app` email.
3. Code, once the legal name is known: legal name and one contact in the `nadhir.app` footer;
   the entity in `/privacy` and `/terms` (both live).
4. Business verification with the RC/NIF certificate or association receipt showing legal name
   and address (3–7 business days, per secondary sources).
5. Create the Meta app; request PPCA in App Review with a screencast from an ITA post to the Civil
   Publication Nadhir makes from it. PPCA's allowed use is to analyse and display Page posts.

Until approval, a development-mode app reads only Pages whose admin holds a role in the app.

## Cutover to the Graph API

- A `graph` fetcher reads `/{page-id}/feed` and returns `ItaFeedPost`; `ita_facebook` switches to
  it with a `parser_version` bump. Contract, RPC, dedup and extraction are unchanged.
- The same PR deletes the Apify fetcher, the `APIFY_*` secrets and the Apify task.
- Tariki, the DGPC Facebook page and DGF each become a separate decision on the same collector.

## Tests

- Mapping, with fixtures cut from real datasets pulled on 2026-09-28: a post and a `no_items`
  record; a schema failure uses that post with `text` removed.
- pgTAP: the same post from both sources inserts once; a text edit inserts a revision; a
  region/type-only website change inserts nothing; a lost `ita_facebook` lease is refused.
- Runner: an empty window succeeds with zero posts; a capped 403 fails as
  `upstream_unreachable`; the lookback follows `data_from` within 20–60 minutes.

## Out of scope

Tariki, the DGPC Facebook page and DGF (after PPCA); comments and reactions; images and video.
